# Unit 0x01

## Tasks

You can use the file `westrosecliff.cpp` in the `solutions` folder as a starting point for your own solution.

<hr>

### ðŸ‘‰ Task 'West Rose Cliff'

Input and Output:

- Read an integer number `n` of type `int` and a character `c` of type `char`.
- Test if the number `n` is greater than `0` and if the character `c` is an uppercase letter.
- Define boolean variables with the test results and output them.

Extension:

- Use the `?` operator instead of an if-statement where possible.

<hr>

### ðŸ‘‰ Task 'Blue Canyon'

Calculation of `b^n`:

- Read variables `b` and `n` of an appropriate type. Calculate 'b to the power of n' in a loop and output the result.

Extension:

- Write a function `pot` that receives `b` and `n` as parameters and returns the result.
- Define the function `pot` after main and only provide its signature before `main`.
- Formulate the loop once as a for-loop and once as a while-loop.
- Use 'const' where possible.

<hr>

### ðŸ‘‰ Task 'Beverly Hollow'

Calculation of the Fibonacci sequence `(f_i)`:

- Read an integer number `n` from the console.
- Calculate the first `n` Fibonacci numbers `f_i` iteratively, i.e. in a loop (not recursively) and output them.
  The rule is: `f_i = f_(iâˆ’1) + f_(iâˆ’2)` with `f_0 = f_1 = 1`.

Extension:

- Consider which approach (iteratively vs. recursively) is (presumably) faster and why?

<hr>

### ðŸ‘‰ Task 'Pine Point'

Prime number calculation:

- Read an integer number `n` from the console.
- Write a function `isPrim` that receives a number and returns `true` or `false`.
- Test the function for different numbers, use `assert`.

<hr>

### ðŸ‘‰ Task 'AI'

What would the AI say about it?

Pick one solution and ask a GenAI-Tool of your choice (e.g., ChatGPT) for its opinion.
- What improvements are suggested?
- Do they make sense?

<hr>

### ðŸ‘‰ Task 'Couch Potato' - Recurring homework.

- If you have not completed the main tasks in the exercise, complete them at home.
- Study `work_int8`, `work_string`, `work_switch`, `work_for`.

<hr>

## Comprehension Check

- I have understood all codes and exercise topics. I can create and execute a C++ program.
- I know different data types and can define, declare, read, process and output them.
- I am familiar with the control structures 'if-else', 'do-while', 'while' and 'for'.
- I know how to call a function, define or declare it.
- I know the namespace 'std'.
