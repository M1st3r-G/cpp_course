# C++ Course for Experienced Programmers

## Overview

This crash course is designed for programmers who:

- Already have programming experience
- Know another object-oriented language (Java, C#, Python, etc.)
- Want to learn C++ implementation techniques

The course assumes familiarity with fundamental programming concepts like classes and loops. Instead, it focuses on
C++-specific features and language constructs, explaining their practical applications and use cases.

## Course Structure

The material is organized into units, each containing:

- **Essentials**: Core C++ concepts and practical topics
- **More**: Additional examples and in-depth content for self-study

Note to enrolled students: The "More" sections are part of the required curriculum.

## Repository Structure

- `snippets/`: Code examples and demonstrations
- `solutions/`: Complete solution implementations
